A dead-simple Twilio app with Sinatra and Heroku.

To deploy to Heroku:

1. Clone the app
2. heroku create
3. git push heroku master

notes 
*****

-A-
The 'signup' link for heroku from the public heroku-twilio webpage is no longer valid:

this is the link in question--> http://www.heroku.com/signup/twillio  via  http://twilio.heroku.com/  

however, the issue is a non-issue: heroku signup is available, quick, and easy. not having that direct link should not affect twilio implimentation. i had concern that this could lose some form of automated setup â€” it doesn't.

-B-
i have not been able to hear the audio in the video "How to create a Twilio app in Ruby with Sinatra and deploy it to Heroku in 5 minutes" (while using chrome 16) @ http://twilio.heroku.com/

this is a direct uri that yields video with audio--> http://av.vimeo.com/10970/299/4108930.mp4?token=1325801800_2fb11997091592359726f85ce7e33c29
hm... that didn't work (shouldn't have stopped it). this one is working now, maybe the token kills it?

(sory vimeo if that's not cool - you're a great service - i just want to learn about twilio and need the sound)
